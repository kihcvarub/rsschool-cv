## Briefly about myself

A JS/FE beginner, having no experience in coding but willing to learn something new. Currently working in the Higher education field (doing administrative work), related mainly with design areas, having English language practice with the native speakers. Previously worked in a sphere close to the IT security (dealing with documentation). 

I am motivated to study in my pace trying not to miss any important theoretical parts and consistently practicing various briefs and cases to gain basic skills in coding, so that eventually I would have something real to update this CV with.  

I would say that I am able to be hardworking and focused when demanded, treating my actions with attention to detail, open for criticism. Working in the office and open space environment for several years has taught me to work in the team and now I would like to gain basic knowledge that helps me to find a way to work independently someday - although I understand that this field implies team-work as well which makes it an even more multi-aspect experience to embrace.
